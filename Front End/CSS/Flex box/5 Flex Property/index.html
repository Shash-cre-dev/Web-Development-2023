<!-- To Understand Flexbox -->
<!-- A Parent Element is present which becomes the Flexbox Container -->
<!-- A number of child elements inside that parent element can be considered as flex items -->

<!-- Here nav is parent element and div's inside it are child element -->
<!-- Other eg can be ul or ol be the parent element and li's inside them be the children element -->

<!-- To make flexbox we add display:flex to the class of the parent element -->
<!-- 

(parent class)
.container{
    display: flex;
} 
 -->

 <!-- /* By default flexbox, Elements take space from left to right  
 /* By default flexbox is a block element that takes up the entire width available on the screen*/

 */ -->
 
 <!-- 
FLEX DIRECTION

A Flexbox container always has a direction

By default the flex direction is row (horizontal), starting from LHS to going RHS
Therefore, the Main Axis goes from Left to Right (horizontal)
and Cross Axis goes from top to bottom (vertical)

This is not the case always, depending upon the flex direction, the axis can be swapped
for flex direction column, the main axis is top to bottom (vertical)
and Cross Axis goes from left to right (horizontal)

Depending upon the main and cross axis many css properties apply

By default flex-direction: row, elements are placed left to right(ie Main Axis L-R, Cross Axis T-B)

For flex-direction: column elements are stacked from top to bottom (Main Axis T-B, Cross Axis L-R)
-->

<!-- 
JUSTIFY CONTENT

It allows to position flex items together along the Main Axis

justify-content: flex-start (by default), all elements are sticking at the start of the main axis

justify-content: flex-end, all elements are sticking at the end of the main axis

justify-content: center; all elements will stick at the center of the main axis

justify-content: space-around; it provides space between each element on LHS and RHS (elements don't stick at any ends of Main axis)

justify-content: space-betweem; it provides an equal space  between each element (elements  stick at the ends of Main axis)

justify-content: space-evenly; it provides space between the elements same as of space-around but here space with the ends of Main axis is equal to the space between elements

-->

<!-- 
POSITIONING ITEMS

To position items individually along the Main Axis use margin-left or margin-right property.
Target it by using respecive class names of the flex items.

margin-left: auto - places an element at the end of the Main Axis (puts a margin from the left side)

margin-left: right - places an element at the start of the Main Axis (puts a margin from the right side)

other values of margin-left or right can to used also like for px or rem

Note that the element on which it applies also affects other elements if they are after it

Eg

.search{
    margin-left: auto 
}

It makes search element at the end of the Main Axis, but since logout is also after th search element
it also gets moved to the end of the Main Axis

For flex direction: column
margin-top and margin-bottom are used similarly

-->

<!-- 
FLEX PROPERTY

Allows you to set width of the flex items with respect to the flex container
(makes the flex items responsive when the size of flex container changes)

applies to children items or their respective classes

.container > div {
    flex: 1;
}

all div (children elements) take up equal space, they expand or shrink equally when flex container size is changes
 
flex is a short hand property for flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis which we shall discuss later

container > .search{
    flex: 2;
}
search element takes twice as space as other contianers and grows or shrinks according to it

using flex container > flex items (or specific flex items) is more specific and gives higher priority

another approach is to make a single item do all the flexing (grow or shrink) and other items are of fixed width and move according to it

.search{
    flex: 2 (1 or any value doen't matter as single element is only flexing);
}

only the search elements takes more width(twice as compared to the fixed width of Home and Logout) and both of these move according to the flexing of Search Item
