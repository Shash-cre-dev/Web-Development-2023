<!-- To Understand Flexbox -->
<!-- A Parent Element is present which becomes the Flexbox Container -->
<!-- A number of child elements inside that parent element can be considered as flex items -->

<!-- Here nav is parent element and div's inside it are child element -->
<!-- Other eg can be ul or ol be the parent element and li's inside them be the children element -->

<!-- To make flexbox we add display:flex to the class of the parent element -->
<!-- 

(parent class)
.container{
    display: flex;
} 
 -->

 <!-- /* By default flexbox, Elements take space from left to right  
 /* By default flexbox is a block element that takes up the entire width available on the screen*/

 */ -->
 
 <!-- 
FLEX DIRECTION

A Flexbox container always has a direction

By default the flex direction is row (horizontal), starting from LHS to going RHS
Therefore, the Main Axis goes from Left to Right (horizontal)
and Cross Axis goes from top to bottom (vertical)

This is not the case always, depending upon the flex direction, the axis can be swapped
for flex direction column, the main axis is top to bottom (vertical)
and Cross Axis goes from left to right (horizontal)

Depending upon the main and cross axis many css properties apply

By default flex-direction: row, elements are placed left to right(ie Main Axis L-R, Cross Axis T-B)

For flex-direction: column elements are stacked from top to bottom (Main Axis T-B, Cross Axis L-R)
-->

<!-- 
JUSTIFY CONTENT (Works on the Flex Container)

It allows to position flex items together along the Main Axis

justify-content: flex-start (by default), all elements are sticking at the start of the main axis

justify-content: flex-end, all elements are sticking at the end of the main axis

justify-content: center; all elements will stick at the center of the main axis

justify-content: space-around; it provides space between each element on LHS and RHS (elements don't stick at any ends of Main axis)

justify-content: space-betweem; it provides an equal space  between each element (elements  stick at the ends of Main axis)

justify-content: space-evenly; it provides space between the elements same as of space-around but here space with the ends of Main axis is equal to the space between elements

-->

<!-- 
POSITIONING ITEMS

To position items individually along the Main Axis use margin-left or margin-right property.
Target it by using respecive class names of the flex items.

margin-left: auto - places an element at the end of the Main Axis (puts a margin from the left side)

margin-left: right - places an element at the start of the Main Axis (puts a margin from the right side)

other values of margin-left or right can to used also like for px or rem

Note that the element on which it applies also affects other elements if they are after it

Eg

.search{
    margin-left: auto 
}

It makes search element at the end of the Main Axis, but since logout is also after th search element
it also gets moved to the end of the Main Axis

For flex direction: column
margin-top and margin-bottom are used similarly

-->

<!-- 
FLEX PROPERTY (Works on Flex Items)

Allows you to set width of the flex items with respect to the flex container
(makes the flex items responsive when the size of flex container changes)

applies to children items or their respective classes

.container > div {
    flex: 1;
}

all div (children elements) take up equal space, they expand or shrink equally when flex container size is changes
 
flex is a short hand property for flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis which we shall discuss later

container > .search{
    flex: 2;
}
search element takes twice as space as other contianers and grows or shrinks according to it

using flex container > flex items (or specific flex items) is more specific and gives higher priority

another approach is to make a single item do all the flexing (grow or shrink) and other items are of fixed width and move according to it

.search{
    flex: 2 (1 or any value doen't matter as single element is only flexing);
}

only the search elements takes more width(twice as compared to the fixed width of Home and Logout) and both of these move according to the flexing of Search Item

-->

<!-- 
ALIGN ITEMS (Works on the Flex Container)
   
Now, We are going to position the elements across the Cross Axis (by default Top to Bottom) 

By default the align-items: stretch; 
   
all the flex items stretch across the cross axis, we can see this by increasing the height of the
flex container

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
  height: 100%;
}

height: 100% only works when html, body height is set to 100% otherwise it will be the height of the flex container

align-items: flex-start ; all flex items stick to the start of the Cross Axis and only take as much height as they are required to display their content

align-items: flex-end ; all flex items stick to the end of the Cross Axis and only take as much height as they are required to display their content

align-items: center; all flex items are moved at the center of the Cross Axis

TO CENTER AN ITEM IN THE CENTER OF THE FLEX BOX CONTAINER
align-items + justify-content set at center can be used


.container{
    border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
    display: flex;
    height: 100%;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

Places all the flex items of the flex container at the center of the flex container

TO ALIGN THE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS
align-self property can be used in respective class names of the flex items

.logout{
    align-self: flex-start;
}

logout is moved to the start of the Cross Axis

.home {
  align-self: flex-end;
}
moves Home to the end of the Cross Axis
-->


<!-- FLEX DIRECTION COLUMN

Now Flex-direction: column; alligns flex items from top to bottom inside the flex container

Now the Main Axis is Top to Bottom
and the Cross Axis is Left to Right

JUSTIFY CONTENT (Works on the Flex Container)

To work with the properties of flex box, set the body, html and flex container height to 100% or any value
before applying the properties

html, body {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #ffeead;
}
.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  height: 100%;
}

justify-content: flex-end; places all the flex items at the end of the Main Axis (Here the Bottom of the flex Container)
justify-content: flex-start; places all the flex items at the start of the Main Axis (Here the Top of the flex Container)

similarly for the other justify-content properties

ALIGN ITEMS (Works on the Flex Container)

Helps in aligning flex items along the Cross Axis, 
by default align-items: stretch (flex items strech along the Cross Axis covering entire width)

align-items: flex-start; places flex items at the start of the Cross Axis (here left of the flex container)
align-items: flex-end; places flex items at the end of the Cross Axis (here right of the flex container)

To place flex items at the center , justify-content and align-items shoud be set to center

.container {
  border: 5px solid #ffcc5c;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: flex-end;
  height: 100%;
  align-items: flex-end;
}

places the flex items at the bottom right of the flex container
-->

<!-- FLEX PROPERTY ADVANCED (Works on Flex Items)

Here using only Home and Logout

.home {
  flex: 1;
}

.logout {
  flex: 1;
}

Here both Home and Logout will occupy equal width and will grow and shrink together

Flex is a short hand property for flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis 

when setting flex: 1; 
it actually sets
flex-grow : 1;
flex-shrink : 1;
flex-basis : 0;

or flex: 1 1 0;


// FLEX BASIS

.home {
  flex-basis: 200px;
}

.logout {
 flex-basis: 200px;
}

flex-basis sets the basis width of the container, if width of flex container is enough they will occupy
the desired width mentioned and on further increase they will remain the same

eg: here if the flex container width is 400px or > 400px, both Home and Logout will be of 200px and won't expand even a bit now
and empty space will be left in case of >400px

//FLEX GROW
decides the how much of the empty space should be distributed to the flex items with the grow of flex container

.home {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-basis: 200px;
}

.logout {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-basis: 200px;
}

since flex-grow:1 to both Home and Logout the empty space will be distributed evenly with grow and shrink of flex container

.home{
    flex-grow : 0
    flex-basis: 200px;
}
.logout {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-basis: 200px;
}

Now Logout will cover the empty space with grow of flex container

flex-grow of flex items work in sync with each other
if both flex-grow: 0 - empty space won't be occupied by any flex item
if both flex-grow: 1 - empty space will be occupied by evenly
if one flex-grow:0 other flex-grow : non zero - empty space will be taken by the non zero flex item
if one flex-grow: non zero other flex-grow: higher non zero - the empty space will be taken by higher flex item and higher will expand with better rate
 
flex-grow: 0 (default)

//FLEX SHRINK

flex-shrink: 1 (By default)
flex-shrink of flex items work in sync with each other

if one flex-shrink:0 other flex-grow : non zero - non zero flex item does all the shrinking
if one flex-shrink: non zero other flex-grow: higher non zero - will shrink with a faster rate wrt to lower rate

.home {
  flex-grow: 0;
  flex-shrink: 5;
  flex-basis: 200px; 
}

.logout {
  flex-grow: 0;
  flex-shrink: 1;
  flex-basis: 200px;
}

Home shrinks 5 times faster than Logout
