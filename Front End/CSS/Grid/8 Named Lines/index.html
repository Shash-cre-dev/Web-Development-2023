<!-- To understand Grid 
There is a Parent Container known as Grid Container

and child elements inside Parent Container known as Grid Items

To change into grid

Grid Container display : grid;

.container{
    display: grid;
}

By Default these items would be on stacked on top of each other as default grid has only a single column

To change this 
grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows used

grid-template-columns defines width of the mentioned columns
grid-template-rows defines height of the rows

.container {
    display: grid;            
    grid-template-columns: 100px auto 100px;
    grid-template-rows: 50px 50px;
}

Here the grid contains 3 columns of 100 px, auto, 100px width (Top to Bottom)
Here the grid contains 2 rows of 50 px, 50 px height (Left to Right)

Total = 3 * 2 = 6 Grid items

auto - takes as much as space provided by the grid container

Another Example

.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 100px auto;                grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 200px;
    grid-template-rows: 50px 50px 200px;    
}

Here the grid contains 2 columns of 100 px, auto width (Top to Bottom)
Here the grid contains 3 rows of 50 px, 50 px, 200px height (Left to Right)

Total = 2 * 3 = 6 Grid items

TO GIVE A GAP BETWEEN Grid ITEMS
grid-gap: 3px;

-->

<!-- 
FRACTION UNITS AND REPEAT

TO MAKE THE COLUMNS AND ROWS OF GRID RESPONSIVE UNIFORMALLY

We used the fr (Fraction Units) while defining grid-template-columna and grid-template-rows

.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: 50px 50px;
    grid-gap: 3px;
}

here there would be 3 coulns of 1fr each, the entire grid is divided into 3 fr and each column gets a single fr
each item grows and shrinks uniformly

grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;

the entire grid is divided into 4 fr and column 2 gets 2 fr, column 1 and 3 1fr each. ie column 2 takes two times space and grows 

A shortcut to define these fr is repeat function

.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 50px);
    grid-gap: 3px;
}

repeat(number or rows or columns, value)

grid-template-coulumns: repeat(3, 1fr); creates 3 coulums of 1 fr each
grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 50px); creates 2 rows of 50px each


TO CREATE GRID BY SHORTCUT USE only grid-template

.container {
grid-template: grid-template: repeat(2, 50px) / repeat(3, 1fr);
}

creates grid with 2 rows 50 px each and 3 columns 1 fr each (Total 2 * 3 = 6 grid items)
grid template: rows / columns
-->

<!-- POSITIONING ITEMS
We will target the class names of the grid items

.header {
    grid-column-start: 1;
    grid-column-end: 3;
}

HEADER will be placed from column line 1 to column line 3 (taking the entire space)

no of column lines = no of columns + 1

Shortcut
.header {
    grid-column: 1/3;
}

.footer{
  grid-column: 1/3;
}

Now FOOTER also spans the entire width of the grid container

grid-column: 1/-1 gives the same output

.header {
    grid-column: 1/-1;
}

.footer{
  grid-column: 1/-1;
}

Suppose no of coluns increased now
.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 3px;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: 40px 200px 40px;
}

No of columns = 12 with 1 fr each

.content {
    grid-column: 2/-1 ;
}

//Here CONTENT spans from column line 2 till the last column line 

with -1, it spans till the end of grid container ie the last column line

It can be used when one doesn't knows the number of columns in the grid container


grid-row can be used similarly as grid-column
Number of row lines = no. of columns + 1

.menu {
    grid-row: 1 / 3;
}

grid spans from row line 1 to row line 3 

CHECK THE PRACTICE IN INDEX.CSS

/* span allows to span the number of rows or columns for that specific grid item 
Used inside the classes of grid items with grid-column pr grid-row
*/

<!-- TEMPLATE AREAS

Allows to change and experiment with the layout very easily

Can also be used to create quick prototype layouts

NOTE: height set 100% in the grid container

To create quick prototype/grids we shall use grid-area in the respective class names of the grid items

but before that we have to give a virtual reperesentation of how our grid will look in the flex container
using grid-template-areas

.container {
    height: 100%;
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 3px;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: 40px auto 40px;
    grid-template-areas: 
        "h h h h h h h h h h h h"
        "m c c c c c c c c c c c"
        "f f f f f f f f f f f f";
}

The number of rows and columns must match as what was desribed earlier

 "h h h h h h h h h h h h" - means the h will span the entire width of all 12 column in the first row

  "m c c c c c c c c c c c" - means the m will span one column and c will occupy the remaining 11 column in the second row

  "f f f f f f f f f f f f"; - means the h will span the entire width of all 12 column in the third (last row) row
 
Total number of rows = 3
Total number of columns = 12

Now we can use these representation of h, m, c, f in the respective classes of grid items via the grid-areas to match the virtualrepresentation defined by grid-template-areas.

.header {
    grid-area: h;
}

.menu {
    grid-area: m;
}

.content {
    grid-area: c;
}

.footer {
    grid-area: f;
}

HEADER spans the entire width in first row
MENU spans 1 column and CONTENT spans 11 columns in the second row
FOOTER spans the entire width in third row

You can now replace elements (interchange h, m, c ,f) in grid-template-areas to make changes

. can be used in grid-template-areas to represent empty boxes

THE AREAS WILL ONLY BE VALID IF THEY ARE RECTANGLES
-->

<!-- AUTO FIT

For Responsive tries to fit as many columns with change to the width of the flex container

.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 5px;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, 100px);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 100px);
}

auto-fit enables to fit as many columns in the first row here when the width of grid container is changed

But there is a problem here some space is left as if size of remaining space < 100px as mentioned for a column, the item doesn't fit in the first row

so we use minmax with auto-fit to solve this problem

.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 5px;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr));
    grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 100px);
}

min - 100px
max - 1fr

Now the items will fit the entire container regardless of it's width

if space required space available to fit one item it will fit that item in the column

if required space not enough, will distribute the equal space to all the columns such that all items expand equally in the first row

-->

<!-- IMPLICIT ROWS

From the Respnsive Laayout created by auto-fit and minmax

There is another problem that appears, when the width of the Grid container is changes
an extra number of rows are created.

These extra number of rows doesn't behave like the typical rows of 100px as mentioned in the grid-template-rows of 100px height, only the 
first two behave according to it as grid-template-rows:repeat(2,100px) creates two rows of 100 px height each.

The rest of the newly created rows can be modified to have the same height of 100 px by

grid-auto-rows: 100px;

modified code of the container looks like

.container {
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 5px;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(100px, 1fr));
    grid-auto-rows: 100px;
}
-->

<!--
NAMED LINES
ANOTHER WAY OF SIZING AND POSITIONING GRID ITEMS IS 

.container {
    height: 100%; 
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 3px;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 5fr;
    grid-template-rows: 40px auto 40px; 
}

Here we have two column one with 1fr and the other with 5 fr

Now the content spans from column line 2 to column line 3 ie between 1fr . 5fr . 
(.represents the column lines)

.header {
    grid-column: 1 / 3;
}
.content {
    grid-column: 2 / 3;
}
.footer {
    grid-column: 1 / 3;
}

so we can now modify it by using the following in the Grid Container ie

grid-template-column: 1fr [content-start] 5fr [content-end]

now .content will be modified as

.content{
    grid-column: content-start / content-end;
}

we can do it similarly for the header and footer as well

grid-template-column: [main-start] 1fr [content-start] 5fr [content-end main-end]

two or more named lines can be placed inside a single bracket with space

.header changes to 

.header{
    grid-column: main-start / main-end
}

.footer{
        grid-column: main-start / main-end

}

for both header and footer main-start and main-end used as to avoid using
extra lines of head-start head-end and footer-start and footer-end

Similarly we can do this for row lines as well

grid-template-rows: [main-start] 40px [content-start] auto [content-end] 40px [main-end]; 

We can further shorten these by only using the named lines without their start or end

.container {
    height: 100%; 
    display: grid;
    grid-gap: 3px;
    grid-template-columns: [main-start] 1fr [content-start] 5fr [content-end main-end];
    grid-template-rows: [main-start] 40px [content-start] auto [content-end] 40px [main-end]; 
}

.header {
    grid-column: main;
}

.menu {}

.content {
    grid-column: content;
}

.footer {
    grid-column: main;
}
