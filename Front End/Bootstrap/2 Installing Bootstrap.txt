TO Add Bootstrap to the Website

We will link the following Bootstrap CDN
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-GLhlTQ8iRABdZLl6O3oVMWSktQOp6b7In1Zl3/Jr59b6EGGoI1aFkw7cmDA6j6gD" crossorigin="anonymous">
in the index.HTML (in <head></head>) of the Website 

For Practice I have linked Bootstrap here in basic.HTML.
