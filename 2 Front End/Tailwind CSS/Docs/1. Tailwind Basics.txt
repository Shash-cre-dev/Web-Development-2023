Learning Tailwind CSS from start to finish.

BASICS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first framework which allows you to style your HTML pages without leaving your HTML file.

The simple explanation of this is that you will have to add some utility classes within the HTML <tags>, and you can design your pages easily
by simply including these classes.

You will not have to write down CSS explicitly.

Advantages of Tailwind

Another reason to use Tailwind is its easy-to-use nature because when you write CSS explicitly in a different file and map it with the HTML file,
you might face some problems. But, when you mention the styles within the HTML file using tailwind utility classes,
the experience of development is enhanced and can be experienced only once you start making projects using Tailwind CSS.

STANDARD WEBSITE WORKFLOW

The standard workflow to design a website using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript
looks somewhat like this.
1) You create HTML files first, followed by CSS files.
2) We use IDs and classes in our HTML files and you style those IDs and classes in the CSS files.

As a result, you must exit the HTML file and enter the CSS file while styling.
Repeatedly switching between HTML, CSS or JavaScript is a pain in the neck while creating a project,
as going back and forth from the HTML and CSS files to design and remap it.

TAILWIND WORKFLOW

In Tailwind CSS, the workflow will look somewhat like this:
1) First, you shall set up Tailwind CSS and after include Tailwind CSS within your HTML file.
2) You will only have to write the HTML code within the HTML files. Without making separate CSS files.

Furthermore, the tag where you insert classes will be styled immediately and after reading only the HTML file, you will realize the
particular designs and styles an HTML tag is using.
