Nav Bar

To point to the links for the various section (webpages) of the website
adding classes to the nav,

class = "navbar" applies all the CSS 
offered via the Bootstrap

All the modifications are applied from the class names

for ul - add class navbar-nav
for individual elements of the nav bar
that are present in the li use class = "nav-item"

The items of the nav bar must contain links to access various sections of the website so we
use anchor tags <a> inside <li> elements
for <a> we use class "nav-link"

When creating multiple nav items via the li, the items are 
stacked vertically on top of the other in their order of creation

for horizontal allignment  use 
navbar-expand-lg with the class "navbar" inside
nav

Eg: <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg">
Strectches the nav bar horizontally to the space available on the screen

lg-means large
md-means medium

<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg bg-light">
makes the nav bar visible with a light background

bg- has special words saved for appyling different colours 
to the background
bg-primary - blue colour
bg-secondary - grey colour
bg-success - green color
bg-danger - red colour
bg-warning - yellow colour
bg-info - light blue color
bg-light - white colour
bg-dark - black colour
bg-linl - for link in blue with underline

they can be used with navbar- for much significant effects
makes the nav bar appear with dark with significant effects
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-dark"


For adding Brand Name 

<a class="navbar-brand" href="">tindog</a>
it will be placed inside <nav> immediately before
<ul> so that Brand Name appears first in the Nav Bar


For adding space between the Barnd Name and Nav Bar elements

target the specific element which contains nav elements
and use ms-auto in the class name here that would be ul

ul class="nav-bar ms-auto"
makes the space between Brand Name and Nav Elements the max - they ares hifted to extreme right

margin space- auto


For Hamburger Menu - Dropdown menu
When the size of screen is shrinked below a certain limit of the screen
use the following following button below the Brand Name

<button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#id_name" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
      <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
</button>

Enclose the list elements (ul) inside a div and give it a specific id which can be used to target the 
drop down menu when the screen size is reduced in data-bs-target section 

<div collapse navbar-collapse id="id_name"> <ul> </ul> </div>
class="collapse navbar-collapse" enables the div to collapse when size of screen is shrinked


When used above brand name, Brand Name shifts to right
When Brand Name placed inside div- it will also come under the 
drop down menu when size of screen shrinked.
