The first thing to do in creating a website is wireframing

wireframes are low-fidelity representations of your website design
It is meant to be done with pencil on paper etc

The idea is to settle on a design before coding it

Wireframes - low fidelity (looks really simple) & shouldn't take too much time to produce

Mockup - high-fidelity representations of your website design
	 - what your website will look like when you have created it
	 - precisely what you want to it


Wireframes - basic layout using pen and sketching / Figma / canva
Mockup - using adobe illustrator/ Figma / canva

The best examples of web design are on dribble
